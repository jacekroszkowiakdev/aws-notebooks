# 1. Create an S3 Bucket

Ensure AWS CLI configuration:

```sh
aws configure
```

If needed to retrieve information about the EC2 instance run:

```sh
# all instances attached to the AWS account:
aws ec2 describe-instances
# by id
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <bucket-name> --region <region> --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=<region>

# Replace:

# - <bucket-name>: A unique name for your S3 bucket (e.g., my-test-bucket-12345).

# - <region>: The AWS region (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-2).

# 2. Upload an Object to the Bucket

```sh
aws s3 cp <file-path> s3://<bucket-name>/

# example copy all files from location
aws s3 cp . s3://<bucket-name> --recursive
```

# Replace:

# - <file-path>: Path to the file you want to upload (e.g., /path/to/file.txt).

# - <bucket-name>: Name of the S3 bucket you just created.

# 3. Try to Access the Object in a Web Browser

# - Go to the AWS S3 console, find the bucket, and copy the Object URL.

# - Try to access it in the browser. You should get an "Access Denied" error because the object is private by default.

# 4. Make the Object Public

aws s3api put-object-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --key <object-key> --acl public-read

# Replace:

# - <bucket-name>: Name of the S3 bucket.

# - <object-key>: Name of the uploaded object (e.g., file.txt).

# 5. Access the Object in a Web Browser

# - Copy the Object URL again (you can find it in the AWS S3 console or it typically looks like https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<object-key>).

# - Open the URL in a web browser. You should now be able to access the object.

# 6. List the Contents of the S3 Bucket Using AWS CLI

aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>/

# Replace:

# - <bucket-name>: Name of the S3 bucket. This will display all objects stored in the bucket.

```

```
