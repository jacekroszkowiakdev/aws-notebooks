## AWS Code Deploy

Automate and Deploy Applications Consistently

Ensure your applications are deployed automatically and consistently across development, testing, and production environments.
Monitor the health of your application fleet, and automatically roll back updates when necessary.
Launch your applications and track their deployment status using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
Reuse your existing setup code and seamlessly integrate with your current software release processes or continuous delivery toolchain.

Automate Deployments to Eliminate Manual Operations

Automate application deployments to reduce the need for manual processes.
Use a file and command-based installation model to repeat deployments across different groups or instances, allowing you to deploy to multiple hosts efficiently.
Manage deployments to thousands of hosts with advanced monitoring and traffic shifting capabilities.
Utilize various deployment techniques, including:
In-place Deployments: Update the existing application directly.
Canary Deployments: Gradually roll out changes to a small subset of users before a full rollout.
Blue/Green Deployments: Switch between two identical environments, minimizing downtime during updates.
Monitor application health and implement rollback strategies.
Configure alarms that can trigger automatic rollbacks and halt ongoing application deployments when issues are detected.
